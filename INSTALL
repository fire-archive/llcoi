The original llco project used CMake just like Ogre does.
It has changed since, and the current maintainers don't use CMake (yet?).
Using a simple g++ command has turned out to be sufficient, but is
obviously not cross-platform.

We will look at getting CMake (or similar) ready sometime soon.
Until then you can use the temporary build script.

##CMAKE
(not sure if this works; needs testing)
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j4 && su -c 'make install'

## Temporary script
There is a very simple shell script for compiling llcoi: "simplebuild.sh"
It's specific to Linux, but it uses g++ so the command can probably be used with very 
little modification on Mac and Windows (mingw?) as well.
Since the script bypasses CMake it becomes necessary to define the DLL global once "by hand".
You can just add the following to the top of the "ogre_interface.h" header file:

```c
#ifdef __cplusplus
#define DLL extern "C"
#endif
```

This will export the binding functions in the compiled shared library - without it, the DLL will probably be useless to you.
